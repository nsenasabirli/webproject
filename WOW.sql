In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.source: georgerrmartin.com', 'English', '9780553588484', '[\'Fantasy\', \'Fiction\', \'Epic Fantasy\', \'Adult\', \'Science Fiction Fantasy\', \'High Fantasy\', \'Adventure\', \'Dragons\', \'Audiobook\', \'Epic\']', '[\'Brandon Stark\', \'Catelyn Stark\', \'Tyrion Lannister\', \'Daenerys Targaryen\', \'Eddard Stark\', \'Theon Greyjoy\', \'Robb Stark\', \'Arya Stark\', \'Jaime Lannister\', \'Joffrey Baratheon\', \'Robert Baratheon\', \'Tywin Lannister\', \'Lysa Arryn\', \'Petyr Baelish\', \'Sansa Stark\', \'Viserys Targaryen\', \'Varys\', \'Hodor\', \'Beric Dondarrion\', \'Thoros of Myr\', \'Sandor Clegane\', \'Samwell Tarly\', \'Pyp\', \'Tommen Baratheon\', \'Stannis Baratheon\', \'Grenn\', \'Mace Tyrell\', \'Septa Mordane\', \'Jon Snow\', \'Cersei Lannister\', \'Jorah Mormont\']', 'Mass Market Paperback', '', 835, 'Bantam', '08/28/05', '08/06/96', '[\'Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)\', \'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (1997)\', \'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1997)\', \'Premio Ignotus for Novela extranjera (2003)\']', 2003043, 96, '[\'The Lands of Ice and Fire\']', 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496.jpg', 562241, 6007, '4.01'),

Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he\'s always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy\'s skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911.  The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he\'s away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle\'s vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven\'t heard, spiking Mary\'s curiosity.  The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett\'s works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy.  The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world\'s major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender\'s two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military\'s purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine\'s abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com', 'English', '9780812550702', '[\'Science Fiction\', \'Fiction\', \'Young Adult\', \'Fantasy\', \'Classics\', \'Science Fiction Fantasy\', \'Dystopia\', \'War\', \'Audiobook\', \'Adventure\']', '[\'Dink\', \'Bernard\', \'Valentine Wiggin\', \'Peter Wiggin\', \'Mazer Rackham\', \'Alai\', \'Hyrum Graff\', \'Andrew Wiggin\', \'Petra Arkanian\', \'\"Bean\"\', \'Major Anderson\', \'Bonzo\', \'Major Imbu\']', 'Audiobook', 'Unabridged', 324, 'Macmillan Audio', '09/30/04', '10/28/85', '[\'Hugo Award for Best Novel (1986)\', \'Nebula Award for Best Novel (1985)\', \'Nébula (1985)\', \'Margaret A.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen\'s best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody\'s business, but she can\'t mind her tongue, so she\'s lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don\'t.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition', 'English', '9999999999999', '[\'Historical Fiction\', \'Fiction\', \'Historical\', \'Fantasy\', \'Classics\', \'Medieval\', \'Audiobook\', \'British Literature\', \'Novels\', \'Adult\']', '[\'Thomas Becket\', \'Henry II of England\', \'Tom Builder\', \'Prior Philip\', \'Aliena\', \'Jack Jackson\', \'Stephen of England\', \'Empress Matilda\', \'William Hamleigh\', \'Ellen\', \'Richard of Kingsbridge\', \'Alfred Builder\', \'Waleran Bigod\', \'Lord Percy Hamleigh\', \'Lady Regan Hamleigh\', \'Remigius\']', 'Paperback', '', 976, 'NAL Trade', '02/04/02', '10/28/89', '[]', 648793, 95, '[\'England\']', 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043.jpg', 392260, 4221, ''),

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children\'s voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden\'s voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger\'s classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951.

Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America’s lonely and dispossessed, Of Mice and Men has proved one of Steinbeck’s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.', 'English', '9780142000670', '[\'Classics\', \'Fiction\', \'School\', \'Historical Fiction\', \'Literature\', \'Read For School\', \'Novels\', \'High School\', \'American\', \'Classic Literature\']', '[\'George Milton\', \'Lennie Small\', \'Candy\', \'Curley\', \"Curley\'s Wife\", \'Slim\', \'Crooks\', \'Whit\', \'Carlson\']', 'Paperback', 'Steinbeck Centennial Edition, US / CAN Edition', 103, 'Penguin Books', '01/08/02', '10/28/37', '[\"New York Drama Critics\' Circle Award for Best American Play (1938)\"]', 1942168, 90, '[\'Salinas Valley, California (United States)\', \'California (United States)\']', 'https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302904l/890._SX318_.jpg', 667925, 7218, '5.75'),
